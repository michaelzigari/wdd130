        <p>"The Great Zimbabwe Ruins, located in Masvingo, are the remnants 
            of an ancient city that flourished between the 11th and 15th centuries. This UNESCO World 
            Heritage site is famous for its grand stone structures, 
            built without mortar, showcasing the architectural ingenuity of the Shona civilization.
            
            As the former capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, it offers insights 
            into pre-colonial African trade, governance, and craftsmanship. 
            Visitors can explore the Great Enclosure, the Hill Complex, and the museum showcasing artifacts 
            from the site."-zimadvocate
